ALTER TABLE customers
-- 2. Because the current column type of `first` and `last` are `text`, these columns have almost no limit to how much content they can store. We've noticed garbage registrations with first and last names over 20kb! Change the column types of these to a varchar with a max of 255 characters.
    ALTER COLUMN first_name TYPE varchar(255),
    ALTER COLUMN last_name TYPE varchar(255),
    -- 3. The `social` column also has some dirty data, some customers have entered their social with dashes, others without, others with spaces. We've decided to store only the numbers of a users social. Which means all `social` values should be exactly 9 characters. Change the column type to allow only 9 characters.
    ALTER COLUMN social TYPE VARCHAR(9),
    -- 4. The `account_number` column has the same issue, the city's account numbers are 14 characters. Update the column type.
    ALTER COLUMN account_number TYPE VARCHAR(14),
    -- 5. Someone forgot to add a `line_2` column, add one.
    ADD COLUMN line_2 VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    -- 6. The `zip` column is currently an integer, but we're loosing digits from customers with zip codes that start with zeros. Change the column type appropriately.
    ALTER COLUMN zip TYPE VARCHAR(10),
    -- 7. Remove the `current_balance_cents` column. It was added for performance reasons, but there's a bug in the application code and it's often out of date.
    DROP COLUMN current_balance_cents;

--statements migrations:
ALTER TABLE statements
    -- 1. The `customer_id` column allows null values, change it so a value is required.
    ALTER COLUMN customer_id SET NOT NULL,
    -- 2. We've updated our water meters and we can accurately measure fractional gallons. Update `gallons_used` to allow for two decimal places.
    ALTER COLUMN gallons_used TYPE DECIMAL(255,2),
    -- 3. Add a default value "payment_due" to `status`.
    ALTER COLUMN status SET DEFAULT 'payment_due';
